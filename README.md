## Description of the Project

An AirBnB clone is a copy of the AirBnB website, where you can find and rent accommodations.

To recreate its functionalities, we're developing a system that mimics AirBnB's operations. We're using a special type of database format called JSON and employing techniques like object-oriented programming, Python data translation, and command interpretation. The outcome is a local database that can be easily adjusted using specific commands, offering a flexible and efficient method for handling data.

The project currently only implements the back-end console.
