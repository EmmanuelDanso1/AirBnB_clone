<!-- About the Project -->

## Project Overview

An AirBnB clone is a copy of the AirBnB website, where you can find and rent accommodations. 

To recreate its functionalities, we're developing a system that mimics AirBnB's operations. We're using a special type of database format called JSON and employing techniques like object-oriented programming, Python data translation, and command interpretation. The outcome is a local database that can be easily adjusted using specific commands, offering a flexible and efficient method for handling data.

The project currently only implements the back-end console.

<!-- Prerequisities -->

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Additional dependencies
  import os
	import json
	import re
	import unittest

<!-- Features and Functionalities -->

## Classes

  - BaseModel -> id, created_at, updated_at
  - FileStorage -> Inherits from BaseModel
  - User -> Inherits from BaseModel
  - State -> Inherits from BaseModel
  - City -> Inherits from BaseModel
  - Amenity -> Inherits from BaseModel
  - Place -> Inherits from BaseModel

## Storage

The above classes are handled by the abstracted storage engine defined in the FileStorage class.

Every time the backend is initialized, HolbertonBnB instantiates an instance of FileStorage called storage. The storage object is loaded/re-loaded from any class instances stored in the JSON file file.json. As class instances are created, updated, or deleted, the storage object is used to register corresponding changes in the file.json.

## Console

The console is a command line interpreter that permits management of the backend of HolbertonBnB. It can be used to handle and manipulate all classes utilized by the application (achieved by calls on the storage object defined above).

<!-- Installation -->

## Installation

Clone the repository:

   ```
  git clone https://github.com/buyekeobare/AirBnB_clone.git
  ```

<!-- Run -->

## Run

You first chnage directory to the AirBnb using this command: cd AirBnB; then

To execute the console use:

```
python3 console.py
```
or

```
./console.py
```

<!-- Test -->

## Test 

To personalize the classes and execute unit tests to confirm that your changes haven't modify the functionality use:

```
python3 -m unittest discover tests
```
